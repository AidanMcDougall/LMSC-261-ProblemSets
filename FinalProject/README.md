# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Work in progress, will be title of game

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "My project is about creating a web-based synthesizer.")

My project will be creating an integrated homepage for a game with menus + options in processing as well as web integration with HTML

## Detail your project in a paragraph or more. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software will be a mock-up menu with artwork, design, and sound for everything that would surround an actual game: what you see when you boot up a game. It will contain menus + embedded links to external information in a mockup site for the game as well. 

## If you plan to combine LMSC-261's final project with another course's project, which other course? Which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to LMSC-261, and which aspect(s) would connect to the other course?

N/A

## In the software world, almost everything takes longer to implement than expected. And it is common to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what **WILL** you accomplish no matter what?

Combination of Processing + HTML, JS, CSS. My challenge will to be to integrate everything together with full functionality.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you **THINK** you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

After functionality, I would like to refine the look and feel of the site + ‘game’ to be very consistent and elegant.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a **BEST** outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

If I could explore API integration on the web side, I would be really thrilled but I’m not sure if I can make that happen in the time.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

I need to research integration between Processing and HTML, as well as more advanced Processing and HTML functions. To come up with ideas for more advanced techniques in Processing, I’ll read their website and see what options would be fun to integrate into my homepage.
