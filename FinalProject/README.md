Welcome to FIREFLY!
this is a concept art piece for a game idea.
Due to time constraints, I have not made a whole game, but have created a mock up which could inspire an entire production. 
To experience the game, open the link below in your preferred browser.

Within the game menu, you have the option to explore a different environment and interact with it.
If the audio is not playing, wait a second for it to load or press the "explore" button to trigger the audio.
For convenience, a 'mute' button has been added to the bottom of the page for the soundtrack.

Even though the project is hosted on P5.JS, I have attached the assets I used into my upload for redundancy.
