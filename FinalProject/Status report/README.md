#### Project title

FIREFLY

***


#### What have you done for your project so far?

Based on your feedback from the live class, I focused my attention on p5.JS and using that to help host my game. I have shifted my focus into improving one quality product as opposed to two lesser ideas. I have compeleted the complete stylization and have completely organized the concept and worldbuilding for my game.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have to implement a lot of features that are still in the 'concept' phase, but they seem attainable- essentially most of the interactivity of the game.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I haven't gotten many issues. I'm not super confident in my js skills but with python's libraries and ChatGPT, I've been able to get through most of my minor issues with ease.
