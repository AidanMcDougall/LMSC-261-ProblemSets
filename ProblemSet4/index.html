        <h3> Modus Vivendi, by 070 Shake </h3>
        070 Shake's debut studio album is an exploration of alternative pop. There is a large emphasis on synthesis and processed audio.
        <p>I consider this album inspiration for the music I like to make as well as a catalyst for me making my own music.</p>
        <p> <a href= "Igor.html"> <img alt= "Igor Cover Art" src="Igor_Cover.jpeg"> </p>
        </a>
        <h3> Igor, by Tyler, The Creator </h3>
       This Grammy award winning album was produced entirely by Tyler, the Creator and is a modern staple for hip hop albums. 
        <p>Every time I listen to this album, I appreciate it more. The production and songwriting is brilliant and is a gold standard.</p>
        <p> <a href= "Mr._Morale_&_the_Big_Steppers.html"> <img alt= "Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers Cover Art" src="Mr._Morale_&_the_Big_Steppers_Cover.png"> </p>
        </a>
        <h3> Mr Morale & the Big Steppers, by Kendrick Lamar </h3>
       Kendrick Lamar's most recent entry into his near-perfect catalog, Mr. Morale focuses less on external issues and more on internal struggles.
        <p>This album has become my go-to when I'm feeling in need of self-reflection.</p>
        <p> <a href= "The_Forever_Story.html"> <img alt= "The Forever Story Cover Art" src="The_Forever_Story_Cover.png"> </p>
        </a>
        <h3> The Forever Story, by JID </h3>
        JID's first solo project in four years, The Forever Story fuses elements from many genres to create an entirely unique sonic palette.
        <p>As a creative, I appreciate how much this album has a distinct sound: every song belongs within the project.</p>
        <p> <a href= "Heaven_or_hell.html"> <img alt= "Heaven or Hell Art" src="Heaven_or_Hell_Cover.png"> </p>
        </a>
        <h3> Heaven or Hell, by Don Toliver </h3>
        Don Toliver flexes his incredible soul-inspired vocals on a tracklist that contains hit after hit.
        <p>I love Don's voice, especially on beats like these.</p>
