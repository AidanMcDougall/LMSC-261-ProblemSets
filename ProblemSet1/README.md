## Submission Guideline
Create a new folder named `ProblemSet1` under your problem set GitHub repository. Add `PhoneBookSearch.txt` and `README.md` into this folder. Commit and push to complete your submission.

## Grading Rubric

## Problem 1.1: Syllabus Quiz

Read the syllabus and take the syllabus quiz on OL under **1. Computational Thinking**.

## Problem 1.2: GitHub

[**GitHub**](https://github.com/) is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. GitHub lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere. Most importantly, we will be using GitHub to submit your problem sets and projects in this class.

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or a set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. Students pursuing software engineering skills must learn how to use a version control system such as **Git**. GitHub makes this procedure straightforward for us.

### Set up GitHub and Clone the Class Materials
- Go to [github.com](github.com) and create a new account. Share your GitHub user name with your instructor to access the class repository. 

- Go to [desktop.github.com](desktop.github.com) and download the GitHub Desktop App. Launch GitHub Desktop. Sign in to GitHub.com with your account.

- Click on the `Clone a Repository from the Internetâ€¦` button in the GitHub Desktop app. Click on the `URL` tab and type in `github.com/LMSC-261/LMSC-261_Class_Materials`. Click on the `Clone` button and check the `Documents/GitHub/` directory for the cloned repository in the Finder. 

### Create a New Repository for Problem Set Submission
- Let's create a new repository that you will be using to submit your problem sets and projects.

- In the GitHub Desktop app, click on the `Create a New Repository on your Hard Drive...` button. Alternatively, you can use the shortcut command cmd-N.

- Type in a name for your repository (i.e., `LMSC-261-ProblemSets`). Give a description and initialize the repository with a README. Click on the `Create Repository` button. You should now have a new folder inside the `Documents/GitHub/` directory in the Finder.

- Click on the `Publish Repository` button to reflect the local change on the GitHub server. Now, make a folder (i.e., ProblemSet1) within the new repository. Copy/paste the `README.md` file created earlier into this new folder. Changes should now appear on the left side of the GitHub Desktop app. Write a summary of your changes. Click on the `Commit to master` button and then `Push origin` to reflect your local changes to the repository.

- Each week, you will create a new folder within the `LMSC-261-ProblemSets` folder that you will use to submit your problem sets and projects. For example, a folder with the problem set next week (Problem Set 2) may be named `ProblemSet2`.

- Ensure that you add the instructor's GitHub user name (`navreyort`) as a collaborator in your repository for grading. Please follow the instruction [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository) on how to add collaborators.

- Make sure to check if you have access to the class materials repository.

- Also, ensure you created your problem set repository with a correct folder structure and name that your instructor can access.

## Problem 1.3: Markdown

- **Markdown** is an easy-to-read, easy-to-write syntax for formatting plain text. You can convert files written in Markdown to many output formats, including HTML. The file extensions for Markdown can be `.md` or `.markdown`.

- Markdown is used to format `README.md` files on GitHub. Styling `README.md` on the GitHub platform makes it easier for us to read. The `README.md` file must be named exactly for GitHub to recognize and format your texts in your repository.

- Your task in this problem is to write your `README.md` file. In your `README.md` file, You will describe the pseudocode in the [PhoneBookSearch.txt](https://github.com/LMSC-261/LMSC-261_Class_Materials/blob/main/01.ComputationalThinking/02.PseudoCode/PhoneBookSearch.txt) file that we covered in the class using plain English.

- Answer the following questions in describing the pseudocode:
	1. What is the algorithm doing?
	2. What method is the algorithm using to get to the solution?
	3. What is the result of the algorithm if the solution is not found?
	4. What happens when the algorithm finds the solution?

- Your description of the pseudocode must be at least a paragraph long, and your `README.md` must at least contain the following:

	1. 1 Heading
	2. 1 Italic
	3. 1 Bold

- Include both `PhoneBookSearch.txt` (copy/paste from [here](../02.PseudoCode/PhoneBookSearch.txt)) and `README.md` in your problem set 1 folder to get full credit.
